# CSS Speech Bubble

This is a demo of a responsive speech bubble.

index_ver1
The tip is a scalabe vector graphic (SVG) positioned in a pseudo element (::after).
The speech bubble works best with a minimum font size of 30px.

index_ver2
The tip is a skewed rectangle and works without any SVG. 
But the connection point of the tip and box isn't perfect.
